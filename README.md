## Structures

### Fragments:
The fragments were downloaded directly from Fragalysis. The fragments SDF used is [A71EV2A_combined.sdf](fragments/TO_USE/A71EV2A_combined.sdf).

### Template
> fragments/prepare_template.ipynb

The [template](fragments/TO_USE/Ax0310_relaxed_apo.pdb) was prepared with some tweaks (using the [relax script](https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-A71-2A-elaborations/blob/5e11d605337b20f9c415b2bb6a1fc409bab479c5/iteration-2/code/relax.ipynb) from Matteo Ferla)

NOTE: The fragments SDF was loaded into a pymol session with the relaxed template and checked by eye to makes sure they are put in the CORRECT active site. 

## Designs

There are 140 base compound designs. After placing base compound designs to the template, X were successfully minimised. Therefore these designs are used as input to Syndirella's pipeline.
