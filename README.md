### Structures used for placement:
1. Fragment hits: [A71EV2A_combined.sdf](fragments/A71EV2A_combined.sdf). (Downloaded directly from Fragalysis). Checked each fragment to make sure that they overlap in space. 
2. Template: [x0310_relaxed_apo.pdb](fragments/x0310_relaxed_apo.pdb). Created by Matteo Ferla using [relax.ipynb](https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-A71-2A-elaborations/blob/main/iteration-2/code/relax.ipynb). 
Then edited with [prepare_template](notebooks/prepare_template.ipynb).
