# EV-A71-2A-syndirella-run

### Structures used for placement:
1. Fragment hits: [fragments/clean_hits.sdf](fragments/clean_hits.sdf). 
2. Template: [x0310_relaxed_apo.pdb](fragments/x0310_relaxed_apo.pdb). Created by Matteo Ferla using [relax.ipynb](https://github.com/matteoferla/EV-A71-2A-elaborations/blob/main/iteration-2/code/relax.ipynb). 
Then edited with [prepare_template](notebooks/prepare_template.ipynb).

### Status:
**2024-03-04 13:30:** Running [batch0](batches/batch0.csv) again with relaxed apo template.

Currently running [batch0](batches/batch0.csv) as of 2024-02-29 19:00 with 9 base compounds and placing the top 10K.
➡️ Placements didn't work since template I was using still contained the ligand...
